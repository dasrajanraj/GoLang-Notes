- Excellent community
    Faster response in the community.
    Nicely documented

- Key features
    - Simplicity
        The syntax of the language is easy to understand
    - Fast compile times
        One of the basic reason for faster compiling is the it maintain the acyclic dependency graph and any unused import throws an error while compiling
    - Garbage collected
        It has built-in GC, so the developer don't have to care about the memory-management
    - Built-in concurrency
    - Compile to standalone binaries
        It compile everything in golang package in a single binary including libraries and other go dependency

Points
1. Execution Flow
    Program execution start with main package and main function
